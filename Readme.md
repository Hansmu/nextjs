<h1>Next.js</h1>

Next.js renders our pages with initial data that helps us avoid an initial
loader. This allows for better SEO as well. It fetches data on the server
and renders finished pages. After that you're still going to enter the usual
flow of a React app.

File-based routing. You define pages and routes with files and folders instead
of code. You have less code, thus less work, and it's highly understandable.

Fullstack capabilities. Easily add backend code to your Next/React apps. Storing
data, getting data, authentication etc. can be added to your React projects.
